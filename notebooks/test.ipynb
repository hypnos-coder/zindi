If fever is above 38°C, delay for 72 hours after treatment. The example case mentioned that high fever might denature vaccine proteins and the child is at risk due to low immunity.\n",

The nurse should treat the fever first. The summary should mention the diagnosis of possible upper respiratory tract infection or another mild infection. The plan would include treating the fever with antipyretics, monitoring, and then administering the vaccine once the child is afebrile and recovered. Also, the nurse should counsel the mother on the importance of immunization and proper care.\n",
